# Audio_capturing_using_DL_Technique

HOW WE WORK IN AN AUDIO CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM IN CNN:

In Cnn: voice capturing its a different process : use “librosa” bcoz its better than scipy. 
Scipy is a “stereo wave” 
Librosa is a “mono wave” the wave is parallel
Audio frequency range : neg to pos

librosa also do scaling process

it contains the “ audio frequency data” & “audio sample rate as a parameter
